- **5-Level Priority System**: critical, high, medium, low, info
- **Multi-Modal Notifications**: Toast, Desktop, Sound, Voice announcements
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- **Subscription Management**: Component-specific alert filtering

### 2. React Hooks Library (`hooks/use-alerts.ts`)

- **8 Specialized Hooks** for seamless component integration:
  - `useGlobalAlerts()` - Global alert state management
  - `useAlertSubscription(component)` - Component-specific alerts
  - `usePredictionAlerts()` - ML prediction alerts
  - `useSystemAlerts(component)` - System error/success alerts
  - `useLocationAlerts(location)` - Location-based alerts
  - `useAlertSettings()` - User preference management
  - `useAlertStats()` - Alert statistics and counts
  - `useVoiceAlerts()` - Voice announcement system
